## Description of calibratable parameters

A detailed description of the calibratable parameters is given below. 

| Parameter name | Units |  Physical limits  | Range tested for stability | Applies to individual soil layers or entire model domain | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| theta_r | - | 0<theta_r<1, theta_r<theta_e | 0.01<theta_e<0.15 | Soil layer | theta_r is the residual water content, or the minimum volumetric water content that a soil layer can naturally attain. Note that theta_r must be less than than theta_e. |
| theta_e | - | 0<theta_e<1, theta_r<theta_e | 0.3<theta_e<0.8 | Soil layer | theta_e is the maximum volumetric water content that a soil layer can naturally attain. Note that theta_e must be greater than theta_r. |
| alpha | 1/cm | alpha>0 | 0.001<alpha<0.3 | Soil layer | alpha is the van Genuchten parameter related to the inverse of air entry pressure. Note that in nature, expected values of alpha are distributed logarithmically, so calibrating on the log of alpha rather than alpha directly is likely a better choice for most calibration algorithms. |
| n | - | n>1 | 1.01<n<3 | Soil layer | n is the van Genuchten parameter related to pore size distribution. Note that another commonly reported van Genuchten parameter, m, is related to n via m = 1 - 1/n. We recommend that n>1.01. Values larger than 3 are acceptable. |
| Ks | cm/h | Ks>0 | 0.001<K_s<100 | Soil layer | K_s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil. Note that in nature, expected values of K_s are distributed logarithmically, so calibrating on the log of K_s rather than K_s directly is likely a better choice for most calibration algorithms. |
| ponded_head_max | cm | ponded_head_max>=0 | 0<=ponded_head_max<=5 | Entire model domain | This is the maximum amount of ponded water that is allowed to accumulate on the soil surface. While stability tests have only included a maximum value of 5 cm, any value greater than or equal to 0 should be acceptable. A common choice will be 0. This parameter can be set in the config file.  |
| field_capacity_psi | cm | 0<field_capacity_cm, field_capacity_cm<wilting_point_psi | 10.3<field_capacity_cm<516.6 | Entire model domain | This is the wilting point of the model domain, expressed as a capillary head. Together with wilting_point_psi, the field capacity is used to determine the intensity of the reduction of PET to become AET. The numbers 10.3 cm and 516.6 cm correspond to pressures of 1/100 atm and 1/2 atm of water. Note that the model generally uses absolute values of capillary head; in this case, these limits are absolute values of negative numbers and physically represent unsaturated soil. While field capacity will vary per soil type, we use a single value for the entire model domain, following the method for PET->AET correction used by HYDRUS. This parameter can be set in the config file. |
